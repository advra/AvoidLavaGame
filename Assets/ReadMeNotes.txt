Brians Comments:

- MODE: limited number of flings per area (every 100 meters or something, maybe more rocks before more cluttered)
	- "instead of time, maybe keep time, the higher you go up it keeps track of how high youve gone in terms of meter (start adding spikes)"
- map go from linear to complex (no discourage, make an easier map)
	- easy level
- visual appeal (glow effect closer to the bottom)
